#BR NOTE - Sorry Lon, I decided to re-do colonization from the ground up. I got too annoyed trying to
# colonize Annunimas in vain, and it's always easier building a new event than fixing someone else's

# JamesFox has made major changes and additions to these

# colonisation_wilderness  : generic, not available for immortals, wilderness, or Dwarves. A special event for Númenórean/Dúnedain cultures.
# colonisation_wilderness_with_dwarves : non Dwarves/Maiar/Istari can colonize hills or mountains with longbeard Dwarves if they have a Dwarven courtier
# colonisation_wilderness_with_elves : non Elves/Maiar/Istari can colonize with silvan Elves if they have an Elven courtier
# colonisation_wilderness_with_halflings :  non Hobbits/Maiar/Istari can colonize with Hobbits if they have a Hobbit courtier

# colonisation_mountains_for_dwarves  : colonizing mountains/hills with Dwarves, by Dwarves
# colonisation_nonmountains_for_dwarves  : colonizing some NON-mountains/hills with Dwarves, by Dwarves (costlier)
# colonisation_general_for_elves : Colonization for and by Elves. A special event for High Elves.
# colonisation_wilderness_human : Allows 'Good Side' non-human races to colonize using Humans. Human culture used depends on colonizer and year.
# colonisation_wilderness_with_forodwaith: Colonize arctic province with Forodwaith. Coastal provinces get lossoth, non-coastal get Hillmen.
# colonisation_wilderness_for_evil_overlords_orc : Orc/Troll colonization by Sauron/Evil Istari/Dragons/Nazgul/Balrog/Evil Maiar

# TODO :
# colonisation_wilderness_for_evil_overlords_human
# ~ split up colonisation_wilderness into multiple decisions/events so the proper species-culture can be picked
# ~ make colonisation_wilderness_human multiple-choice
# allow istari to colonize using hobbits
# allow Bombadil to colonize with hobbits, breelanders, or even Huorns.
# special colonization for those who only own wilderness
# there is provision for Valar colonizing using humans, but not maiar.
# colonization_for_eagles ?
# colonization for ents ?
# wights?  spiders ?
